What is the difference between C and C++?
	The main difference is the object-oriented programming paradigm. C has structs to group related data together, but C++ also has classes that group data and code together. There is also other useful things like inheritance and Polymorphism.

Qus : What is the need for an infinite loop in Embedded systems?
Ans : Embedded systems need infinite loops for repeatedly processing/monitoring the state of the program
		Example:
			While(Boolean True) OR for(;;);
			{
			//Code
			}
		For e.g. Customer care Telephone systems where in a pre-recorded audio file is played in case the dialer is put on hold..
		
		
Qus : A vast majority of High Performance Embedded systems today use RISC architecture why?
Ans :

Qus : What is Memory Optimization and code Optimization ?

Qus : Write a Swaping to numbers without using third variable?

Qus : What is function pointer?
	Ans :	A function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function that can later be called through that function pointer. This is useful because functions encapsulate behavior. For instance, every time you need a particular behavior such as drawing a line, instead of writing out a bunch of code, all you need to do is call the function.
			But sometimes you would like to choose different behaviors at different times in essentially the same piece of code.
			Read on for concrete examples. 
			
			Function Pointer Syntax					:	void (*foo)(int);
			Reading Function Pointer Declarations	:	void *(*foo)(int *);
			Initializing Function Pointers			:	To initialize a function pointer, you must give it the address of a function in your program. 
														The syntax is like any other variable:

															#include <stdio.h>
															void my_int_func(int x)
															{';lkj
																printf( "%d\n", x );
															}

															int main()
															{
																void (*foo)(int);
																/* the ampersand is actually optional */
																foo = &my_int_func;

																return 0;
															}
